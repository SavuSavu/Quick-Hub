# BOMStorm Graph Search Bug - Tasks

## Problem Summary
- Searching in the dependency graph causes the graph to freeze and floods the console with duplicate highlighting logs.
- A TypeError occurs at scripts.js:972:30: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'then')`.
- The error is likely due to improper handling of the return value from `cyInstance.layout(...).run()`.
- Excessive logging for duplicate highlighting may impact performance and usability.

## Tasks

### 1. Analyze and Fix TypeError
- Investigate the use of `.then` after `cyInstance.layout(...).run()`.
- Ensure the layout function returns a promise as expected, or refactor to handle synchronous/asynchronous cases properly.

### 2. Optimize Search and Highlight Logic
- Review the logic for adding nodes/edges and highlighting duplicates during search.
- Prevent unnecessary re-adding of nodes/edges and redundant highlighting.
- Consider limiting or debouncing search input to avoid rapid, repeated processing.

### 3. Reduce Excessive Logging
- Remove or reduce `console.log` statements inside loops, especially for duplicate highlighting.
- Keep only essential logs for debugging.

### 4. Test and Validate
- Test the graph search with large SBOMs to ensure performance and stability.
- Confirm that the UI remains responsive and errors are resolved.

### 5. Document Fixes
- Update this tasks.md with notes on changes and testing results.
